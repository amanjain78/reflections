How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

 Staging area acts as an mediator between the working directory and the git repository. Changes pertaining to one logical changes over a number of files can be submitted as one commit.

 How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

 We can move things to the staging area one at a time and when all the changes corresponding to one logical changes in any number of files are finished we can commit all those changes.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

When we want to add some new features which are colliding in nature we can create a branch and carry on with the two branches in parallel.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

Diagrams help us in keep track of the branching structure since when you checkout to a previous commit in a branch and make commit to it and if dont have the commit id of the previous commit where we checkout then that commit would be lost. A branching structure will help us in maintaing those commits as with the help of the commmit id we can check that version as well.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?

We get the combined result of tho branches. Representing in the way is easier to visualise as after the merging only the parent branch will be remained.
