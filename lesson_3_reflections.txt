When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

This is helpful when a large number of developers work on a single file. It is convenient to push your changes on the remote as other will work on top of it.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

There may be changes that we wont be interested in. As a large number of developers wil be working on a project and not all the changes will be useful for me, in such case we may need to pull changes only when it is required.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Fork is used to copy an existing repository on github on your github. Clone is used to either make a local copy of any repository on github or make copy of any repo on your local machine from another path. Branches is used to form a nonlinear structure to the commits.
